Goal: 
  - create a wickrIO chatbot that takes conversations with the users in a Wickr chat window
  - turns user questions into a prompt
  - send prompt to Google Gemini Pro (using an api key)
  - gets the response from gemini and sends it back to the user in the chat window

Additional Requirements
  - Need to implement logging function as wickerlogger from the jogger.js file. For all logging use module.exports = { WickrLogger: logger }
