# Wicker-Gemini-Chatbot App
An easy to get started Wickr IO API Example integration template which shows the basic code needed to get started writing a Wickr IO API integration.
Note: This is a good template to edit and create a custom integration for Wickr

To get started, you would need to setup your system, download and install Docker and run the WickrIO Docker container. Full instructions on how to do so are available here: https://wickrinc.github.io/wickrio-docs/#wickr-io-getting-started

## Configuration:

- Working WickrIO integration server and Wickr chat bot created in the Wickr Network
- A Secrets Manager Secret called  "gemini_pro_api_key" must be created with the following info {"api_key":"<<gemini_api_key_value>>"}
- The root directory must be compressed to a file called "software.tar.gz" and be imported in the WickrIO server.
